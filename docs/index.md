# RoR Interface & Addon Docs

Welcome to the preview documentation site for the interface assets that ship with this repository.
The navigation links on the left are generated automatically from the files inside the `interface/`
directory every time MkDocs builds the site. Use the **Interface Browser â†’ Latest overview** entry to
explore Lua scripts, XML layouts, CSV tables, and converted textures.

!!! tip
    When you push updates to the `codex` branch the preview workflow rebuilds the docs and publishes
    them to GitHub Pages. That lets you review the MkDocs site before merging any changes into `main`.
